# My-first-python-rpg

Hello github, im franz, im 15 year old, and this is my first project in python. a text-based test game using OOP.

I started learning how to code 10 days ago so dont expect much hehehe and
its still a work in progress but im documenting it in case i loose the file.

Its made in pydroid 3 cause i made it in mobile for about 3 days since i only got the courage to actually build my own project on the 7th day.

It only has basic rpg stuff like a classic turned based loop and a basic set of skills like attack, heal, and defend. though heal and defend actually requires mana to make it more balanced.

It has a class character to manage entities and a class game engine to manage the battle loop and game loop.

Its also data driven so it would be more manageable and it would be more easy to add things in the future.

And thats pretty much it for now, thank you for viewing it!.
